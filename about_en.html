            <h1 class="one">About Us.</h1>
            <p class="two"   style="width:100%;padding-left:9%;padding-right:9%;">
                Rockplay is a Dutch (Punk-)rock band. The band has four members: (Lead Singer/Piano), Milan (Guitar), Fret (Bass) and Darren (Drums/Percussion).</p>
             <br>
             <h2 class="three">The first years</h2>
             <p class="two"  style="width:100%;padding-left:9%;padding-right:9%;">
                Rockplay started on the first of April of 2013 on the band's High School <span>Tabor College Werenfridus</span>. Their name was  not the same as it is now, they were known as the <span>Assessment</span> guys. Fret had put up an ad in the hallway, allowing people to sign themselves up for the band. Jason was the first to respond. He said he could play guitar and sing (which later turned out to be false, as he said in an interview). Milan responded too. Darren - as said in a later interview - was asked to join too by Fret. The band, as it was in 2013, later changed their name to <span>The Mob</span> (2014) after which they changed their name to the name with which they would become world-famous: <span>Rockplay</span> (2015). They initially became popular with their tracks <span>The Fly</span> (Cover of <b><a href="https://www.u2.com" target="_blank">U2</a></b>'s version), <span>Girl</span>, <span>New Year's Eve</span> and <span>Winter of Hate</span>.</p>
             
            <h2 class="three">the breakthrough</h2>
             <p class="two"  style="width:100%;padding-left:9%;padding-right:9%;">In 2015, the band broke through in a legendary way. Shortly after changing their band name to Rockplay, they released their "The Forgettable Fire" album. Little did they know, that within two days, their album would take over the international Top-40 lists of the most popular songs, making the band world-famous. As said in a later interview, the band first thought their buddies were making some sort of "sick joke" when they tried telling the band, but they found out their friends were not kidding when they went to Amsterdam the next day. Almost everyone recognized them from their album, and they were absolutely flabbercasted of the happening.</p>
             
             <h2 class="three">The Present
             </h2>
             <p class="two"  style="width:100%;padding-left:9%;padding-right:9%;">
             After the releases if the <span>Tunes of Unguiltiness</span> and <span>Tunes of Wisdom</span> EPs in 2017 and 2018, the band is going on their second ever tour, the <span>Ungluitiness/Wisdom Tour</span>. Before the tour started, the manager (Jappie) made clear that the band needed a break first. Therefore, the band will go on a winter break after 2018's Christmas.</p>
